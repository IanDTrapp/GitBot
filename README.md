# GitBot
A GroupMe Bot rigorously trained to alert you to GitHub repository pushes

# Creating a GroupMe bot
To begin, we will need a GroupMe Bot. You can create one by going to
https://dev.groupme.com/bots
You can call it whatever you would like, but I chose to call it "GitBot." Feel free to give it a profile picture or save that part for later.
Keep this page open, because we will need the bot ID later.

Special thanks to GitHub user wreed12345 for a great tutorial on getting started on GroupMe bots with Google Script
