# GitBot
A GroupMe Bot rigorously trained to alert you to GitHub repository pushes

# Creating a GroupMe bot
To begin, we will need a GroupMe Bot. You can create one by going to
https://dev.groupme.com/bots

You can call it whatever you would like, but I chose to call it "GitBot." Feel free to give it a profile picture or save that part for later.
Keep this page open, because we will need the bot ID later.

# Creating a Google Script
In your browser, open Google Drive and create a new file. You'll want to select "more" and click "Google Apps Script" as your file type.
From here, you can choose either the default code found in GitBot.gs, or create your own alert with GitBotTemplate.gs.
Whichever path you choose, you will need to copy it and paste it in to your new Google Apps Script document.
